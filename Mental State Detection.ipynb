temps que je suis dÃ©primÃ©e/dÃ©pressive mais jâ€™ai toujours rÃ©ussi Ã le cacher (mÃªme Ã moimÃªme) Mais rÃ©cemment je nâ€™y arrive plus Je nâ€™arrive plus Ã rien Je ne vais presque plus en cours car personne ne mâ€™y attend Un soir je suis sortie avec mes deux meilleures amies et Ã©tant un peu bourrÃ©e je leur est avouÃ© que je sentais seule et que jâ€™avais besoin de les voir plus souvent Mais Ã§a nâ€™a rien changÃ© se voit toujours autant quâ€™avant câ€™est Ã dire 1 fois par semaine Tout le reste de la semaine je suis seule dans mon appartement Je travaille que quand je nâ€™ai plus le choix Quelques semaines plus tard lors dâ€™une autre soirÃ©e et encore bourrÃ©e (cette foisci jâ€™Ã©tais Ã deux doigts du coma Ã©thylique) je suis mise Ã pleurer et avouer beaucoup de mes problÃ¨mes et lâ€™une des deux mâ€™a accompagnÃ©e Je ne voulais pas en parler mais je crois que je nâ€™en pouvais plus de mâ€™imaginer en train de leur avouer mes problemes et quâ€™elles rÃ©conforte je crois que je voulais que Ã§a devienne rÃ©el Mais encore Ã§a nâ€™a pas marcher puisque que jâ€™ai appris que lâ€™une des deux Ã©tait Ã©nervÃ©e et dÃ©Ã§ue de moi car je lâ€™ai empÃªchÃ© de profiter pleinement de sa soirÃ©e et quâ€™elle aurait prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© rester chez elle plutÃ´t que de voir avouer mes problÃ¨mes Aujourdâ€™hui il des nondits entre nous et personne nâ€™ose aborder le sujet alors je suis de nouveaux seule et sens encore plus mal Je ne sais plus quoi faire think Ive hit actual rock lately left want die bad feel like fuck good life want over left feel hope heart ache fuck left feel got
